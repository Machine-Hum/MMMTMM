Music Makers who Make Music. We're designing and building 100% open source eurorack modules.

## Drum
This is our most active project right now. V2 is finished and off to fab, testing results and sound samples will be in soon! This drum is a classic which takes inspiration from the 808 service manual. This guy has knobs all over the place and a HPF and LPF on the output. Very early stage of the design.
